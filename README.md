This repository contains code for the MHIST image classification project, where the primary model utilized is ResNet-18. The project involves training a classifier to predict whether an image belongs to one of two classes: Hyperplastic Polyp (HP) or Sessile Serrated Adenoma (SSA). GradCam was used to generate heatmaps on 5 sample images on the test set to highlight the important regions that the model used to make predictions.
